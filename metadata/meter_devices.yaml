  description: Multifunction whole house meter and home display, 
    #given the different sample rates and cumulative energy mixed, phase one treat the meter
    #as having only 2 measurements power real fine and power reactive, comment out the rest
  sample_period: 1 # the interval between samples. In seconds.
  max_sample_period: 300 # Max allowable interval between samples. Seconds.
  measurements:
  #- physical_quantity: cumulative energy   #energy low res - cumulative energy use every 35 minutes approximately
    #type: active   # active (real power), reactive or apparent?
    #upper_limit: 10000000
    #lower_limit: 0
  #- physical_quantity: cumulative energy   #energy high res - cumulative energy use every 10 minutes approximately
    #type: active   # active (real power), reactive or apparent?
    #upper_limit: 10000000
    #lower_limit: 0
  #- physical_quantity: power   #power real standard - power granularity < 30 Seconds
    #type: apparent   # active (real power), reactive or apparent?
    #upper_limit: 10000
    #lower_limit: 0
  - physical_quantity: power   #power real fine - power granularity  1 Second (no data if no change)
    type: apparent   # active (real power), reactive or apparent?
    upper_limit: 10000
    lower_limit: 0
  - physical_quantity: power   #power reactive standard granularity  1 Second (no data if no change)
    type: reactive   
    upper_limit: 10000
    lower_limit: -10000
